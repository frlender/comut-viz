# Comut-viz

An online app for creating comutation plots

https://frlender.github.io/comut-viz-app/

## Introduction

Current tools for creating comutation plots are either offline packages that require coding or online websites with limited customization. We developed Comut-viz to interactively filter and visualize molecular information as downloadable comutation plots. It includes colored labels for numeric metadata, a preloaded palette for changing colors and two input boxes for adjusting width and height. It accepts standard MAF files as input and can handle large MAF files with >200k rows. As a front-end only app, Comut-viz guarantees privacy of user data and no latency in the analysis.
